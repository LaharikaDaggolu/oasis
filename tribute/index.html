            <h2>About Albert Einstein</h2>
            <p>
                Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity,
                one of the two pillars of modern physics (the other being quantum mechanics).
                He is best known for his mass-energy equivalence formula E=mc^2 (which has been dubbed "the world's
                most famous equation"). Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation
                of the photoelectric effect.

            <h2>Quote</h2>
            <blockquote>
                "Imagination is more important than knowledge.
                For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world,
                stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."
